- 👋 Hi, I’m @idurz or in real life Rudi Zengers, living in the south of Netherlands, close to the Belgian border
- 👀 I love to work on home automation and IoT projecets. Next to the technical stuff, I love the Italian culture and language. La dolce vita, hmm wish I could be there tomorrow ;-)
- 🌱 Over the years I was involved lots of areas within IT. My first steps in programming where in the traditional Pascal language. After that programming
- changed into developping, and with languages like Python and NodeJS I needed to work on my programming skills again. Some things I played with and
- are mature enough to be shown you will find on these pages.
- 📫 Find me on my mail address which is my first name, the at sign and my last name. Add the .net domain and you can send me a mail.
